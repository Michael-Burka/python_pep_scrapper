# PEP Numerical Index Scraper

## Overview

The PEP Numerical Index Scraper is a focused tool designed for parsing the Numerical Index of Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) directly from the official Python website. This utility uses Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and SQLAlchemy for database interactions. It is streamlined to fetch data from the PEP documentation page and store it effectively into a local SQLite database.

### Key Features

- **Efficient Data Extraction**: Retrieves PEP details directly from the web and stores them in a database.
- **Simplified Design**: Minimalistic design focusing solely on parsing and storing data without additional complexities.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes SQLAlchemy to manage database operations, ensuring data integrity and ease of querying.

### Usage Scenarios

- **Academic and Educational Use**: Suitable for students and educators looking for practical examples of web scraping and database integration.
- **Data Analysts**: Helpful for analysts interested in summarizing or tracking changes in PEPs.
- **Python Developers**: Useful for developers who need to automate the retrieval of updated PEP information for project planning or documentation purposes.

## Getting Started

### Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the repository**: Access the project on GitHub and clone it to your local environment.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. **Set up a virtual environment**: Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies separately from your global Python environment.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Unix/macOS:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3. **Install dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies using the requirements file.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Run the script**: Launch the script to start the data scraping and storage process.
    ```bash
    python pep_scraper.py
    ```

### Command Line Arguments

The script is designed to be executed without the need for specific command line arguments, focusing on simplicity and direct execution.

### Example Usage

To start scraping PEP data and populating the database, simply run:
```bash
python pep_scraper.py
```

## Detailed Functionality

### Data Extraction

Connects to the PEP website, extracts data from the Numerical Index table, and stores each entry in the SQLite database. This includes PEP numbers, titles, status, and authors.
